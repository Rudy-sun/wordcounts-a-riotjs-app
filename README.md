# wordcounts-a-riotjs-app
WordCounts a little single page web app created using riot.js version 2.0

This is a single page web app demonstrating the use of the riot.js framework (similar in some ways to react.js).
It also shows the beginnings of a good code and component structure for organizing code.

Just open wordcounts.html in a recent browser (I've only tested this in Firefox.)

Then, click on "select a text file" and select paul_graham_essay.txt (included)

It will then process the file and show you the top 25 word counts.
It will attempt to group words with similar stems together such as talk, talked, talking, etc.

You can also drag and drop to rearrange words. 

This is an example I'm still working on -- it is not yet complete, but still very useful as an example.
I intend this to learn from the user's rearrangements of words so subsequent documents are processed per the user's preferences.
